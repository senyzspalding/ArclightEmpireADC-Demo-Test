    <bioghist>
      <p>Josiah DuBois E-572, was born on December 12, 1779 to
      Cornelius DuBois and Gertrude Bruyn. He was baptized at the
      New Paltz Reformed Church on January 3, 1782. On September
      22, 1805, he married Elizabeth Hasbrouck (1789-1815),
      daughter of Josiah Hasbrouck and Sarah Decker. The marriage
      took place at the Reformed Dutch Church at Shawangunk, NY.
      Josiah had two children by Elizabeth: Sarah and Pamelia.
      After the death of Elizabeth in 1815, he married Catherine
      Winfield (1789-1833), daughter of Dr. Elias Winfield of
      Kingston. Josiah and Catherine had six children: Elizabeth,
      Gilbert, Edward, Josiah, Antoinette, and Jane. On January 16,
      1834 Josiah married third Nancy Wiltsie (1790-1869), but had
      no further children. This marriage took place at the Reformed
      Dutch Church at Beacon, NY. Josiah DuBois died in 1867.</p>
      <p>In the early 19th century, Josiah entered into a
      partnership with his father-in-law Josiah Hasbrouck and
      “carried on the mercantile business in what is now the Jean
      Hasbrouck Memorial House”, now owned and operated as a museum
      by Historic Huguenot Street. In 1822, he built a brick house
      on Libertyville Road in New Paltz now known as the Blake
      House. He also became a trustee of the New Paltz Academy upon
      its incorporation in 1833 and became a part-owner in 1845.
      New Paltz election records show that he was elected to the
      position of Overseer of the Poor several times between 1832
      and 1837, and in 1837 was also elected to the position of
      Overseer of the Roads. During his lifetime he was affiliated
      with the Dutch Reformed churches at New Paltz and Shawagunk,
      and became active in the affairs of the Grand Army of the
      Republic.</p>

      <p>The large majority of the collection documents the real
      estate holdings and financial activities of Josiah DuBois
      during the early nineteenth century. The account books and
      loose receipts provide documentation of the management of the
      store located in the Jean Hasbrouck House on Huguenot Street
      by both DuBois and his father-in-law, Josiah Hasbrouck. Other
      financial activities covered include newspaper subscriptions,
      taxes, court fees and judgments, expenses concerning,
      advertising, livestock, transportation, and farm and
      construction work, and DuBois’ work as Overseer of the
      Poor.</p>
      <p>Estate and legal papers such as deeds, mortgages,
      agreements, bonds, survey maps, and other papers relate to
      the DuBois family’s land holdings in Libertyville and
      elsewhere in New Paltz during the eighteenth and early
      nineteenth centuries. Documents dating prior to 1815 chiefly
      concern Josiah DuBois’s father and grandfather, both named
      Cornelius DuBois, and great-grandfather, Solomon DuBois,
      although other family members (including New Paltz founder,
      Louis DuBois) are also occasionally represented. Two of these
      documents are in Dutch. Of particular importance here are
      several court documents and estate inventories from 1816-1825
      relating to the care of Josiah DuBois’ mentally unstable
      brother Cornelius Bruyn DuBois (1783-1825). Also of interest
      are the numerous wills and inventories of DuBois family
      members such as Cornelius DuBois, 1780-1781, Margaret DuBois,
      1784, Cornelius DuBois Jr., 1803, and an undated late
      nineteenth-century inventory of a woman identified only as
      “Mrs. DuBois.”</p>
      <p>The collection also includes daguerreotypes and
      ambrotypes, most of which are identified, of the DuBois
      family members and relatives from the Catlin, Elting,
      Hoysradt, and Van Wagner families.</p>
      <p>The physical condition of the collection is generally
      fair, showing damage from tearing, fraying, folding,
      yellowing, and worn and detached bindings. Some documents are
      badly torn, with only fragments remaining. The handwriting
      tends to be clear and legible throughout the collection.</p>
