    <bioghist>
      <p>Wilhelmus Hasbrouck (E-540) was born on February 2, 1775
      to Jacob I. Hasbrouck and Sarah DuBois in Stone Ridge, New
      York. On November 9, 1798 he married Agetta Freer of New
      Paltz (1779-1834), daughter of Jonathan Freer and Margrietje
      Deyo. Between 1799 and 1812, Wilhelmus and Agetta had seven
      children: Margaret, Sarah, Maria, Jacob, Moses, Elisabeth and
      Aaron.</p>
      <p>Wilhelmus’ second son, Moses Hasbrouck (F-979), was born
      on March 12, 1807 and baptized at New Paltz. On September 1,
      1856 he married Sarah Maria Freer (1817-1856), daughter of
      Hugo and Elizabeth Freer, and had two children: Sarah M. (b.
      1854) and Jane E. (b. 1856). Moses later married second Lana
      C. Sax (1823-1866) and third, Mary M. Perkins (1836-1875).
      Moses Hasbrouck died on September 12, 1886 and is buried in
      Saugerties, New York.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent>
      <p>The papers primarily reflect the real estate and economic
      transactions of Wilhelmus Hasbrouck, Moses Hasbrouck, and
      Sarah M. (Freer) Hasbrouck, Johannes Freer, and Simon Deyo in
      the towns of New Paltz, Hurley and Saugerties in Ulster
      County, New York. Records include receipts, deeds, mortgages,
      notes, bonds, wills, family records, maps, and photographs
      from the Freer, Hasbrouck and Deyo families of New Paltz, New
      York. Other names include Samuel Bevier, Johannes Blanshan,
      Almond Canfield, Moses Cantine, John B. Davis, Jacob DeWitt,
      Henrick Deyo, Johannes Deyo, Philip Deyo, Frederick de Zeng,
      Stephen Eckert, Roelof and Ezekiel Elting, Wilhelmus Emerick,
      Hugo Freer, David Freer, Joseph Gashiere, Abram Hasbrouck,
      Jacob Hasbrouck, Hans Kierstead, Peter LeFevre, Mary Leggett,
      Petrus Ostrander, William Peters, John E. Schoonmaker,
      Zacharius Slater, Garrit Van Keuren, George Wirtz, and Moses
      Yoeman.</p>
      <p>Of note are several receipts of Johannis Freer in the
      Dutch language (1754-1775); receipt for the sale of a slave
      (1787); a document certifying that Moses Freer has received
      standard equipment for his duty with Captain Brown’s Light
      Company of Foot, dubbed the “Ulster Greys” (1833); will of
      Johannes Freer (1796) and a letter to Nicholas Sickles from
      William Cantine concerning a boundary dispute between
      Wilhelmus Hasbrouck and “Judge Hasbrouck” (1843). Also of
      particular interest are marriage certificates and family
      records of the Deyo, Freer and Hasbrouck families in the late
      nineteenth century, one of which includes photographs of
      Simon R. Deyo and Sarah M. Hasbrouck, who were married in
      1877 at the Reformed Church of the Clove in High Falls. One
      document celebrating the birth of Elizabeth Hasbrouck in 1785
      is somewhat unusual in that it contains a very decorative
      picture of birds and flowers in several colors.</p>
      <p>Throughout the collection, the run of the papers are
      incomprehensive and inconsistent. The majority of the papers
      date from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
      although the collection is most comprehensive from 1753-1797.
      The papers are generally in fair to good condition, but some
      of the deeds show signs of damage such as tearing and foxing,
      and several of the marriage certificates and family records
      are quite dirty. The collection also contains the family
      Bible of Wilhelmus Hasbrouck, originally owned by Johannis
      Freer (Bible #71), which forms part of Historic Huguenot
      Street Bible Collection. This Bible includes family records
      of the Wilhelmus Hasbrouck family. Transcriptions of the
      family records are available. This collection was formerly
      known as the Trautwein Collection.</p>
