    <bioghist>
      <p>Lewis Coe Bevier (F-349) was born on August 1, 1844 to
      Benjamin H. Bevier and Sallie A. Ellmore. He served in the
      Civil War in 120th Volunteer Regiment, Company G of the Union
      Army from 1862-1865. On June 3, 1869 Bevier married Mary
      Tompkins (b. 1849). He was later elected Town Clerk in the
      town of Lloyd in 1873. Bevier was listed as living in
      Brooklyn, New York in the 1880 Census, and received mail in
      Poughkeepsie as late as 1922.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <p>The large majority of the collection consists of letters
      written by Lewis Coe Bevier to his family in New Paltz
      Landing (Highland), Ulster County, New York from various
      locations near Washington D.C. during the Civil War. Topics
      include news of battles, illnesses, wounds, and deaths of
      officers and soldiers from the New Paltz area, and hospital
      and camp conditions. A few of these letters have been
      transcribed in The Historian: The Newsletter of the
      Bevier-Elting Family Association, an Affiliated Family of the
      Huguenot Historical Society (Mar. 15, 1998).</p>
      <p>The letters begin in August 1862, with Lewis writing to
      his parents that he is enlisted in Company G of the 120th
      Regiment of New York State Volunteers and is traveling to
      Washington D.C., describing his brief stops in New York,
      Philadelphia, and Baltimore along the way. Accompanying him
      are several friends, also from Lloyd, Charles DuBois, Charles
      Johnson, Lewis M. Dillon, and Clark Palmiteer. Throughout the
      entire course of the correspondence, Lewis frequently writes
      to his parents about the condition of his various friends
      either serving with him or who have remained at home. Other
      names mentioned include Silas Van Wagenen, Charles Bleecker,
      Silas Deyo, James Terwilliger, Charles DuBois, Ira DuBois,
      Ben Johnson, Alfred Goitichs (Goetschius), Haleckiah (also
      spelled Aleckiah, or just Aleck) Deyo, Josiah DuBois,
      Benjamin Day Cook, Jerome Relyea, Joseph Reynolds, James A.
      Hyde, John Eyett, Henry Johnson, John Brinkerhoff, Edward
      Wilcox, and Isaac (surname unidentified).</p>
      <p>For of his service, Lewis worked chiefly as a cook and
      assistant in several camp hospitals around Washington D.C.
      Some of these specific camps were Fitzhue Plantation, Potomac
      Creek, Windmill Point, Fairfax, Petersburg, and Brandy
      Station. While working at these duties, Lewis often wrote of
      his comfortable lodgings, food rations, and his efforts to
      send payments back home. In addition to working as a cook, he
      also occasionally writes of working as a mail boy and
      commissary, and at building forts, cutting trees, street,
      digging trenches, standing guard, and drilling. Lewis also
      describes hospital conditions, news from battles (including
      the Battle of Fredericksburg), the death of General Stonewall
      Jackson, burning an abandoned rebel camp, occasional prayer
      meetings and sermons, and soldiers injuring themselves in
      attempts be granted discharges.</p>
      <p>In 1864, Lewis increasingly writes of being assigned to
      picket duty and fighting in battles, which he describes in
      some detail. Of particular interest are references to
      exchanging coffee, tobacco and soap with the rebels across
      the picket lines, a bloodless capture of an entire rebel
      picket line, the 1864 Presidential Election, Lincoln’s
      assassination, playing pranks on officers, and black troops
      serving on the front lines. The language used by Lewis is
      also of interest in that it is particularly colorful and full
      of slang and popular phrases from the time, such as “first
      rate,” “bully,” “like fun,” and “Old Jeff” (in reference to
      Jefferson Davis). For example, Lewis writes on August 7, 1864
      that he “received those suspenders and they came first rate
      for I had only one suspender and I could not keep my pants
      up.” In another instances, he writes of having “just bully
      times,” and “it rained like fun but I stood it like a
      major.”</p>
      <p>In addition to letters written by Lewis, the collection
      contains five very descriptive and observant letters written
      by regimental physician John N. Miller, originally from
      Highland. Written to Lewis’ parents, these letters describe
      in detail numerous several aspects of Miller’s work and
      experiences. Of particular interest are letters describing
      news of local men serving in the 120th regiment, Miller’s
      role as a surgeon at the Battle of Gettysburg (Aug. 17,
      1863), his observances of a Southern village near Culpepper
      (Virginia), particularly noting the slave buildings and the
      behavior of the women (Sept. 27, 1863), the grueling work and
      unhealthy living conditions imposed on the soldiers during
      the Winter campaign at Fredericksburg (Jan. 19 and Dec. 29,
      1864), and concerns about losing his medical practice to
      competitors back home while he is serving in the war.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains invitations concerning
      occasional Veteran’s reunion events from 1897 to 1922 and a
      photographic postcard showing Lewis Coe Bevier with the rest
      of the surviving members of his company in 1913.</p>
