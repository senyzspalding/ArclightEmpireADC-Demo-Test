      <p>James and Alexander are the sons of Philip Ayres and Sarah
      Ann Requa. Philip and Sarah married in the Guilford Church on
      December 12, 1839. Sarah was the daughter of Gilbert Kipp
      Requa and Elizabeth Woolsey.</p>
      <p>The Ayres family can be found in the 1850 United States
      Census. Philip Ayres, a 30-year-old carpenter lived in New
      Paltz with his wife, 29-year-old Sarah D. Ayres, three
      children, James N. (aged 9), Alexander (aged 7), and Albert
      (aged 1). Also listed is Elizabeth Requa, who is Sarah’s
      mother. Philip died sometime between 1852 and 1855. The New
      York State Census of 1855 lists Sarah A. Ayres as a 36
      year-old widow, working as a ‘tailoress’ in the town Lloyd,
      with two sons, Albert and Phillip. Alexander Ayres, aged 11,
      is living in the household of John and Hanna B. Requa in the
      town of Gardiner. Sarah married John Eyett by 1859, who James
      addresses letters to at this time. In the 1865 Census, Sarah
      and John both claimed to have married twice, Sarah has
      claimed to have 10 children; this likely includes John’s
      children from his first marriage.</p>
      <p>James Ayres moved to Carroll County, Illinois and Solen,
      Ohio by 1859. He joined Company F of the 52nd Illinois
      Infantry in 1861, was stationed at “Camp Sampson” and Cairo,
      Illinois, participated in the Battle of Corinth and the
      Battle of Pittsburgh, and died on October 19, aged 21.</p>
      <p>Alexander Ayres enlisted with Company I of the 2nd U.S.
      Infantry in Kingston, NY, was primarily stationed near
      Washington D.C., and died in July 1863, aged 19.</p>
      <p>James and Alexander Ayres are the sons of Philip Ayres and
      Sarah Ann Requa. They had a brother, Albert, born in
      approximately 1849. Philip died sometime between 1850 and
      1855. Sarah married John Eyett by 1859. Sarah was the
      daughter of Gilbert Kipp Requa and Elizabeth Woolsey, born
      1819 and died in 1892.</p>

      <p>The earliest letters predate the Civil War. These include
      two letters between Philip Ayres of Libertyville (town of New
      Paltz), Ulster County, New York and Thomas Requa of New York,
      New York, reminiscing about childhood in Libertyville, family
      news, the weather, life in general, and steamboat travel to
      New Orleans on a ship named “Manchester.” Another early
      letter, probably dating from 1839, is addressed to Miss Sarah
      Anne Requa of Libertyville, care of Moses Wolsey (Woolsey)
      and discusses family news and visits.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of letters dated from
      1859 to 1864 and relate to James H. Ayres and Alexander
      Ayres. Most of these letters were written to and from their
      parents back home during their military careers, and describe
      various aspects of camp life, battles, hospital treatment,
      scenery, and the weather.</p>
      <p>James H. Ayres earlier letters are from his time in
      Carroll County, Illinois, and Solen, Ohio discussing work
      prospects in civil engineering and the ‘good country’ in
      Ohio. In 1861 James writes about enlisting in the Union Army
      and relocating with his regiment to the Chicago area. At this
      point, he is optimistic and enthusiastic about the war and
      military service, remarking about his clothes and the ‘good
      spirits’ of the regiment. In early 1862, James H. Ayres
      writes of his changing opinions about war after viewing
      battles, prisoner exchanges, and soldier burials, which he
      describes in some detail. On March 26, he writes that “this
      war will be a lesson to A great many boys me for one included
      if I get out of this alive I will know better another time.”
      In the spring, James writes that he is growing weary of the
      war, and has contracted the measles, which has allowed him to
      temporarily leave the unit on a furlough. The following
      summer, James writes home discourage his younger brother
      Alexander from enlisting in the army, prior to Alexander’s
      enlistment. On September 23, James writes from Camp
      Montgomery near Corrinth and says that “we are having verry
      good time now, but it rains nearly all the time, this dose
      not hurt us we are tough and constant.” The next letter
      written home comes from a family friend near Argo named
      William H. Balcom informing the parents about the James’
      death on October 19th from wounds he that he received on
      October 4th in the Battle of Corrinth. Several more letters
      from Balcom discuss his efforts to send James’ belongings and
      the ‘fatal bullet’ back home, to secure the wages owed to
      James’ family, and to find out more details the soldier’s
      death. Another letter sent to the parents from March 31, 1863
      includes a badly faded albumen print photograph of James H.
      Ayres’ grave taken by the surviving members of his
      company.</p>
      <p>In addition to corresponding with his parents, there are
      also letters between James and friends and family members
      serving in the army elsewhere. Letters written to James from
      Peter Holman describe the Battle of Pittsburgh and other
      friends and family in the service, including James Holman,
      James Hall, Delancey Kingon, Joseph Wallace, and Captain S.S.
      Dunn. During the Spring and Summer of 1862.</p>
      <p>The letters of Alexander Ayres were written during the
      period of November 1862 to May 1863. Most of these letters
      were written from New York City and Long Island where
      Alexander was stationed from late November through February,
      although there are a few letters written from Kingston in
      early November 1862 and three letters written from Falmouth
      near Washington D.C. in March and April 1863. The subjects
      covered in these letters focus on Alexander’s impressions of
      camp life, mostly relating to food, drilling, the weather, a
      stay in a hospital on 319 Broadway in New York after
      contracting the measles, a riot in New York, Central Park,
      members of his regiment that became shipwrecked off Florida
      on their way to New Orleans, and skirmishes near Washington
      D.C. Alexander also briefly makes reference to working “in
      the mercantile business” for DuBois LeFevre, a hotel in
      Kingston owned by Nathaniel LeFevre, and a store owned by
      Josiah DuBois.</p>
      <p>In August, a New York attorney named Adolphus Benedict
      writes to Alexander’s parents that he is “anxious about
      Alexander.” There are no further letters from or concerning
      Alexander, but it is known that he was killed in July.
      However, three more letters written by Benedict while acting
      under power of attorney discuss a lawsuit involving the
      Trinity Corporation and heirs of John Requa in 1866 and 1868.
      There are two other letters in the collection, one written in
      September 1871 from Sarah’s sister, signed A. Church, which
      is most likely her sister Angelina, and another written in
      1900 from Albert to his brother, George, from the town of
      Highland.</p>
