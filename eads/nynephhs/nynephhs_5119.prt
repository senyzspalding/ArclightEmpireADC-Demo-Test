    <bioghist>
      <p>French Huguenot Christian Deyo was born in the province of
      Artois, France (c.1610), and married Jeanne Wibau (c. 1642),
      by whom he had five children. It is believed that Christian
      and his family relocated to Mannheim, Germany in 1660 in
      order to avoid religious persecution. The family then
      traveled to America on the same ship as Abraham Hasbrouck in
      1675. After spending a year at Kingston (then called
      Wiltwyck), the Deyo family settled at New Paltz in 1677,
      where Christian Deyo and his son Pierre both signed the
      patent and became two of the twelve original trustees of New
      Paltz. Other than Christian's mark on the New Paltz Patent,
      the only records referring to him during his lifetime consist
      of testamentary disposition dated Aug. 10, 1676 and a fair
      copy of a slave purchase in 1680. Christian's son, Pierre,
      purchased a slave in 1694.</p>
      <p>Throughout the old documents, Christian is often referred
      to as “Granpere.” In fact, all four of Christian's daughters
      married New Paltz patentees, therefore making Christian Deyo
      the literal grandfather to a large majority of the early New
      Paltz inhabitants. Because of this development, “Granpere’s”
      grandchildren were constantly dividing and redistributing
      Christian’s share of the patent during the next fifty years.
      As Town Historian Al Marks writes, “the DuBois and Deyo
      families were soon brought even closer together by the
      marriage of Abraham DuBois with another of the daughters of
      Christian Deyo, who thus became grandfather of so many of the
      New Paltz inhabitants that even his property became known
      simply as ‘Grandpere’ in the old deeds. The calculation of
      shares of that property passed down to his heirs became,
      after a generation or two, an exercise in high mathematics.”
      When the Freeholders of New Paltz decided to elect the
      “Twelve Men” to administer to the defense of the Patent in
      1738, Daniel Hasbrouck B-6 (1692-1759) was elected to
      represent Christian's share, not a Deyo. In fact, no Deyo was
      ever elected to represent Christian's share throughout the 85
      years of the existence of the institution.</p>
      <p>Christian’s son Pierre Deyo A-2 (also known as Pieter) was
      most likely born in France in 1648. He married Agatha Nicken
      in Mutterstadt, Curr Pfalz, Germany just prior to their
      emigration to America in 1675. Pierre and Agatha had eight
      children, all of whom, it is believed, were born in New Paltz
      and baptized at the Dutch Reformed Church at Kingston, New
      York. In 1692, Pierre built the “Deyo House,” which still
      stands and is now owned and operated by Historic Huguenot
      Street. Pierre died sometime between 1703 and 1708.</p>
      <p>In 1708, Pierre’s lands were divided between his four sons
      Abraham B-1 (1676-1725), Christian B-3 (1681-after 1765),
      Pierre B-4 (1683-after 1755) and Hendricus B-7 (bp.
      1690-after 1737). At this time, Hendricus was given unto the
      care of Col. Jacob Rutsen of Marbletown and his share of
      Pierre’s lands divided between his three brothers. Hendricus
      later married Margaret Van Bommel (1715), had 10 children,
      paid taxes in New Paltz in 1723, and was listed as a
      freeholder in 1728. Abraham B-1 married Elsie Clearwater in
      1702 and had three children. The Deyo House was most likely
      transferred to Abraham after his father's death. 'Two
      surviving receipts reveal that Abraham was a New Paltz
      taxpayer in 1712/3, and Tax Collector in 1723.</p>
      <p>Christian B-3 settled in the hamlet of Springtown in New
      Paltz, married Mary deGraff in 1702 and had seven children.
      He is listed as a New Paltz inhabitant and taxpayer in 1713
      and 1723, respectively, a freeholder in 1728, a slaveholder
      1755, and served as a soldier under Capt. Hoffman in 1716.
      Christian helped to build the Dutch Reformed Church of New
      Paltz in 1720, of which he later served as Deacon and Elder
      in 1733 and 1765, respectively.</p>
      <p>Abraham Deyo C-3 (1710-1777), son of Abraham, married
      Elizabeth DuBois (1735), by whom he had five children. As a
      member of the “Twelve Men,” he represented his grandfather’s
      share of the New Paltz Patent for 64 years (1738-1772).
      Extremely active in town affairs, he was elected Overseer of
      Roads (1763-1764), Overseer of the Poor (1773?), Fence Viewer
      (1761), and Commissioner of Highways (1763-1764). He was also
      appointed Elder of the New Paltz Dutch Reformed Church
      (1766-67, 1771-72, 1775-76), and Church master (?-1777).
      Abraham also became the next owner of the Deyo House.</p>
      <p>Hendricus’ son, Benjamin Deyo C-15 (1725-1798) resided in
      the Bontecoe area of New Paltz. He purchased land there from
      Christophel Deyo C-17 (1762), Abraham Donaldson (1775), and
      from Marinus Van Aken (1785). He married Jenneke VanVliet in
      1751 and had five children. As a member of the Twelve Men, he
      represented Pierre Deyo’s share of the New Paltz Patent in
      1773, and later in 1780-90. Also, in 1780 Benjamin Deyo was
      elected to two town officer positions: Commissioner of
      Highways and Overseer of the Poor. At the Dutch Reformed
      Church at New Paltz, he served as Deacon (1766-67, 1774-75),
      and Elder (1782-83, 93-94). Benjamin also signed the Articles
      of Association in 1775.</p>
      <p>Johannis Deyo, C-16 (1726-after 1761) married Sarah Van
      Wagenen in 1756, by whom Johannis had seven children. He was
      elected Constable of New Paltz in 1761 and appointed Deacon
      of the Reformed Dutch Church at New Paltz (1757). Christophel
      Deyo C-17 (1728-1792) married Debora Van Vliet (c. 1756) and
      had three children. He sold land at Bontecoe to Benjamin Deyo
      in 1761 and 1762. At New Paltz, he was elected Assessor
      (1772-1773), Fence Viewer (1780), and Overseer of Roads
      (1780, 1782, 1788). At the Reformed Dutch Church at New
      Paltz, he was appointed Deacon (1764-1765, 1769-1770) and
      Elder (1779-1780, 1788-1789). Henricus Deyo C-19, like his
      brothers Benjamin and Christophel, (1731-1805) also resided
      at Bontecoe. He married Elizabeth Beem (1753) by whom he had
      six children. At New Paltz he held the positions of Overseer
      of Roads (1776-1777, 1779, 1785-1787, 1789-1790, 1792) and
      Overseer of the Poor (1783).</p>
      <p>Captain Abraham Deyo D-1 (1734-1805) married Elsie LeFevre
      in 1764 and later married Maria LeFevre sometime after 1766.
      Abraham Deyo was commissioned First Lieutenant (1775) and
      later Captain (1778) of the Third Ulster County Regiment,
      Second Company. He was a member of the Twelve Men
      representing his great-grandfather Pierre’s share of the
      patent (1774-1779, 1794-1805), and held numerous offices in
      the town of New Paltz. Positions include the offices of
      Constable (1771), Tax Collector (1771), Overseer of the Poor
      (1773), Fence Viewer (1774-76, 1784-1789), Overseer of Roads
      (1775-1776, 1783-1784, 1788-1789), Commissioner of Highways
      (1779) and Assessor (1790, 1794, 1796). Also active in the
      Church, he was appointed Manager in charge of "building a new
      church at New Paltz" (1771-1775), Church master (1777-1805)
      Deacon (1778-1779) and Elder (1776-1777). According to Ralph
      Lefevre, Abraham Deyo was entrusted with caring for the
      Town's papers during the Revolutionary War when there was a
      fear that the British were going to march on New Paltz. This
      chest was supposedly kept hidden in the cellar of the Deyo
      House, which was at that time owned by Captain Deyo.</p>
      <p>Abraham’s brother Philip D-7 (1752-1831), married Gertrude
      Lefevre in 1781, who bore nine children. Like his brother
      Abraham, Philip was also engaged in numerous public
      activities at New Paltz. He represented Pierre’s share of the
      Patent as a member of the Twelve Men from 1791-1793 and
      served as Overseer of Roads (1792) and Assessor (1795). In
      1791, the Twelve Men selected Philip along with Roelof
      Eltinge and Josiah Hasbrouck to represent New Paltz in a Case
      of Ejectment against Titus Ketchum and the people of
      Marbletown. This case dealt with a long-standing border
      dispute between New Paltz and Marbletown. New Paltz finally
      won the case in 1804. Like the rest of his family, Philip was
      also a member of the Dutch Reformed Church at New Paltz.</p>
      <p>Other Deyo family members represented in the papers
      include William Deyo D-81 (1761-1842) Michael Deyo E-63 (bp.
      1767), Abraham A. Deyo E-2 (1793-1873) and Abraham W. Deyo
      E-257 (1802-1870). William married Sarah Elting (1781), who
      bore eleven children. William bought land in New Paltz from
      Johannis Bruyn in 1793. William served on the “Duzine,”
      representing the share of Pierre Deyo (1806-1818, 1820-1824).
      He also served as Deacon of the Reformed Dutch Church at New
      Paltz (1810-1811). His son, Abraham W. Deyo married Catherine
      Bogardus in 1829 and had five children. Michael married
      Martha Dusebury (?) and had one son, Henry Deyo. Although he
      was listed as a yeoman of New Paltz in 1770, Michael later
      turns up in Beekman, Dutchess County.</p>
      <p>Also serving as a member of the Twelve Men, he represented
      the Patentee’s share of Antoine Crispell (1776-1777). Abraham
      A. Deyo married Margaret T. Deyo (F-3) in 1812, had four
      children, and lived in the Deyo House for some time until he
      relocated to Plattekill, where he served as Supervisor
      (1835-1839, 1841-1842). He may have also served as a circuit
      judge. Following his tenure as Supervisor, Abraham A. Deyo
      served on the New York State Senate from 1843-1846. Upon his
      death in 1873, Abraham bequeathed the house and property to
      his son Abraham A. Deyo, Jr.</p>
      <p>Theodore Deyo F-77 (1831-1893) married Mary E. Elting in
      1855 and had 5 children. Theodore was born at the “Old Deyo
      Homestead” in New Paltz and later owned the property from
      1855-1866. In 1866, he sold the property and purchased a farm
      southeast of the New Paltz village. He attended the Academy
      of New Paltz, pursued studies at Springfield, Massachusetts,
      worked as a clerk for Jewett &amp; Wood in Poughkeepsie, and
      established hardware store in New Paltz, later bought out by
      D.A. Hasbrouck in 1870 when Theodore became Postmaster at New
      Paltz (1870-1884). Theodore also served as a Trustee of the
      New Paltz Academy as well as a member of the Sons of
      Temperance. He was also hailed as a “recognized leader” of
      the Republican Party.</p>

      <p>The majority of the collection concerns the property
      holdings of the Deyo family at New Paltz and Esopus during
      the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Records include

      William Deyo (1812-1833).</p>
      <p>Other items of interest in the collection include a
      “marriage certificate” of Pierre Deyo and Agatha Nicken
