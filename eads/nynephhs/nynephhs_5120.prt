      <p>Individuals primarily represented in the collection
      include Daniel DuBois (1684-1752), Simon DuBois (1719-1791),
      Daniel DuBois (1750-1817) and Daniel I. DuBois
      (1795-1852).</p>
      <p>Daniel DuBois (C-40), son of Isaac DuBois and Mary
      Hasbrouck, was baptized on April 28, 1684 at the Reformed
      Church in New Paltz, New York. On June 18, 1713, he married
      Mary LeFevre (1689 - ca. 1730), daughter of Simon LeFevre and
      Elizabeth Deyo, at Kingston. Together they had eight
      children. Daniel died on April 21, 1752. In 1705 Daniel built
      the House on Huguenot Street in New Paltz known as the
      “DuBois Fort,” which was mandated by the Colonial Government
      to provide a redoubt against Indian attack. (No attack was
      ever reported at New Paltz.) Daniel represented Isaac DuBois’
      share of the New Paltz Patent as a member of the New Paltz
      proprietor’s group known as the Twelve Men from 1738 to
      1752.</p>
      <p>Daniel’s son, Simon DuBois (D-55) inherited the Fort upon
      his father’s death in 1752. He was born on June 28, 1719 and
      baptized at Kingston. On October 7, 1742 he married Catharine
      LeFevre (1721), daughter of Andries LeFevre and Diana Deyo.
      Between 1743 and 1763 they had eight children. At New Paltz
      Simon served as a member of the Twelve Men (for Isaac DuBois’
      share) from 1754 to 1788 and as Overseer of the Poor from
      1755 to 1764 and Overseer of Highways in 1778. He died in
      1791.</p>
      <p>Simon’s son, Daniel (E-134) inherited the fort after his
      father’s death in 1791. Daniel wasbaptized on October 19,
      1750, married Catharine Bessimer at Marbletown, and had no
      children. Daniel (E-134) served as a member of the Twelve Men
      from 1788 to 1794. He died in 1825.</p>
      <p>Daniel I. DuBois (F-201), was born on July 13, 1795 to
      Isaac DuBois and Rebecca Deyo at New Paltz. On August 26,
      1820 he married Magdalene Hasbrouck at New Paltz and had five
      children. In 1825, Daniel received title to the DuBois Fort
      from his uncle Daniel (D-134). Daniel’s (F-201) youngest
      daughter, Mary DuBois Berry (1838-1902) inherited the fort
      after her father’s death in 1858.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <p>The majority of the papers relate to business activities
      of the DuBois family who owned and/or lived in the DuBois
      Fort on Huguenot Street in New Paltz, New York during the
      18th and early 19th centuries. Bulk dates for the collection
      are 1733-1833. Papers include estate and legal papers such as
      deeds, wills, bonds, court papers, estate inventories,
      quit-claims and other documents pertaining to properties in
      the towns of New Paltz and Shawagunk in Ulster county from
      1722 to 1828; as well as receipts and agreements concerning
      domestic goods, property, building supplies, household items,
      etc. dating from 1685 to 1820. The records from the late 17th
      and early 18th centuries, some of which are in French and
      Dutch, primarily relate to financial transactions of Louis
      and Isaac DuBois, both patentees of New Paltz.</p>
      <p>Of particular interest are the probate records of several
      DuBois family members, such as the wills of Daniel DuBois
      (1747); Simon DuBois (1756); Solomon DuBois (1756), which was
      probated 1759 and covered with the front page of the New York
      Revived Weekly Gazette (July 20, 1747); Simon DuBois (1787),
      probated 1799; Daniel DuBois (1810), probated 1825; an
      undated estate inventory of Jonathan A. Lattin (ca. 1825);
      and an auction list of Daniel DuBois (1832). Other items of
      note include a letter from Johannes M. Goetschius to Simon
      DuBois (1760); a receipt describing the medical condition of
      a slave (1770), an agreement that Goetchius will take care of
      Evert Roos, son of Peter Roos (1782); slave purchase by
      Daniel DuBois (1794); memoranda to the trustees of State
      School Districts (1833); and an undated Indian deed
      concerning a tract of land near the town of Marbletown in
      Ulster County, New York. There are also advertisements and
      the Caldwell &amp; Pearson store at Albany, NY (1792), and
      “Everett’s Grand Triple Combination Polyorama…” (undated,
      late 19th century).</p>
      <p>The overall condition of the papers is good and the
      handwriting legible. This collection was formerly known as
      the DuBois Family Papers.</p>

      <p>The majority of the papers were probably donated to
      Historic Huguenot Street by Jesse E. DuBois. Other papers
      were found in the safe of the Jean Hasbrouck House and placed
      in Historic Huguenot Street Archives in 1983. These
      particular papers may have formerly been in the possession of
      Lanetta Elting DuBois, who resided in the Bevier-Elting
      House.</p>
