    <bioghist>
      <p>The papers primarily document the lives of three
      individuals spanning three generations of the Elting family
      in New Paltz, New York: Roelof Josiah Elting C-19
      (1737-1795), his son, Ezekiel Elting D-36 (1763-1842) and his
      son, Jacob Elting E-56 (1803-1889).</p>
      <p>Roelof Josiah Elting C-19 was born to Captain Josia Elting
      and Magdalene DuBois in 1737. In 1760 he married Mary Louw in
      1760 at Kingston and had eleven children. Roelof occupied the
      Bevier-Elting House (now owned and operated as a museum by
      Historic Huguenot Street) during the Revolutionary Period,
      where he kept a store, that was apparently started by his
      father, Josiah. Roelof sided with the Conferentia party
      during the Coetus-Conferentia controversy in the Dutch
      Reformed Church during the 1750’s and 1760’s. In 1766,
      Roelof, along with members of the DuBois, Low, Van Wagnenen,
      Van Vliet, Ean and Auchmody families, left the Dutch reformed
      Church at New Paltz and organized the Conferentia Church, or
      “Owl Church,” on Libertyville Road in New Paltz. The church
      disbanded and rejoined the Reformed Church in 1774.</p>
      <p>Roelof J. Elting was imprisoned as a suspected Tory during
      the Revolutionary War, despite the fact that he signed the
      Articles of Association in 1775 (Sylvester). Along with his
      brother Solomon and friend Cadwallader Colden, Jr., Roelof
      was banished to British-occupied New York. Despite these
      problems, Roelof still managed to gain enough respect in the
      community to be elected to two municipal offices:
      Superintendent of Highways to the Hudson River (1772-1773)
      and Overseer of the Poor (1790). Roelof also served as one of
      the New Paltz Twelve Men for the share of Louis DuBois from
      1791 to 1795. He died in 1795.</p>
      <p>Roelof’s second son Ezekiel Elting D-39 was born on Oct.
      9, 1763, and in 1787 married Magdalene Elting D-35
      (1769-1831), daughter of Abraham Elting and Dina DuBois.
      Ezekiel and Magdalene bore ten children. Ezekiel inherited
      the family homestead from his father and continued the family
      business. According to Heidgerd, “He was probably the most
      important business man in the community. He conducted a
      mercantile establishment in the house he built in 1799 on
      Huguenot Street, now known as the LeFevre House,” (and also
      invariably as the “1799 House” and “Ezekiel Elting House”).
      This house is now owned and operated as a historic house
      museum by Historic Huguenot Street. In 1800 he became a
      member by confession of the Reformed Dutch Church of New
      Paltz and served as Deacon from 1802-1803 and was elected
      Elder in 1812. (RDC, p. 70). Active in local politics,
      Ezekiel served as one of the New Paltz “Twelve Men” for the
      patentee’s share of Louis DuBois (1797, 1801-1824), and as
      Overseer of Highways (1793-1795).</p>
      <p>In 1822 Ezekiel entered into a partnership with his
      brother-in-law Peter LeFevre to build a grist mill, sawmill,
      fulling mill and woolen factory at Dashville Falls in the
      town of Esopus. Ezekiel also engaged in the manufacture of
      potash and owned and operated a farm. According to Sylvester,
      “He was a man of correct business habits, of strict
      integrity, always ready to lend a helping hand to worth young
      men, but most intolerant of wrong-doing in any one. A man of
      excellent judgement, his advice was often sought by his
      neighbors. He was a Federalist in politics.” Ezekiel Elting
      died on December 12, 1842.</p>
      <p>Ezekiel’s son, Jacob Elting E-56 was born on Mar. 27, 1803
      and in 1827 married Gitty LeFevre (1805-1841), daughter of
      Simon M. LeFevre and Elizabeth Deyo, by whom he had five
      children. After Gitty’s death in 1841, he married Elizabeth
      LeFevre (1805-1886) daughter of Peter LeFevre Jr. and
      Magdalene Elting, and had three children. As a boy Jacob
      attended district school at New Paltz ,and one term at the
      Esopus select school. “In 1839 Mr. Elting purchased of Elida
      Watkins the farm in Lloyd formerly owned by his uncle
      Solomon, and here he spent the latter half of his life.” Like
      his father, Jacob was a member of the Reformed Dutch Church
      of New Paltz, where he served as Elder. In politics he was a
      Republican. (Syl. p. 130a)</p>
      <p>Jacob also established the Jacob Elting Burying Ground
      Association in 1875 for the purpose of operating a small
      private family cemetery on Huguenot Street in New Paltz. The
      organization is still presently active. Jacob Elting died on
      August 12, 1889.</p>

    <scopecontent>
      <p>The papers are organized into two series: 1) Account
      Books, and 2) Papers, which include correspondence, estate
      and legal papers, financial papers, genealogical research
      materials and miscellaneous papers. The bulk of the
      collection falls between 1768 and 1843.</p>
      <p>The records of major interest are found in the
      correspondence files. The existence of letters prior to 1800
      in Ulster County is quite rare and the letters of Roelof J.
      and Ezekiel Elting and Andries, Bryant and Simon DeWitt
      provide an excellent source of information on life in Ulster
      County during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
      centuries. Letters to and from Roelof Elting discuss a
      lawsuit with Benjamin Decker; various notes and bonds against
      the Eltings; slaves and goods received from Lt. Col. Burr
      (1778); local religious, political and family matters; a sale
      of property in Chenango, Broome County (undated); shipping
      flaxseed and other domestic goods to merchants in New York
      City, and the events surrounding several boundary disputes
      with the New Paltz Patent in the 1790’s. Of specific interest
      is a letter from Johannes Snyder to the Friends of
      Constitutional Liberty Committee (Roelof J. Elting, Dirck
      Wynkoop, David Hasbrouck, Philip Elting and John Dumont)
      concerning a meeting at R. J. Elting’s house “to Collect
      their Sense on the late daring attack on the Rights of
      Suffrage by the Majority of Conversers.”</p>
      <p>The correspondence of the DeWitt family includes a letter
      from Bryant DeWitt to his father Andries DeWitt concerning
      Gen. Scott’s military expeditions against Native Americans in
      Kentucky (1792); several letters concerning the death of
      Nathaniel Bevier in 1795; a letter to Johannes Hoornbeck of
      Wawarsing from A. DeWitt concerning a bond to Nathan Vernooy
      (1797); letter to Andries DeWitt discussing relations between
      the United States and France (1798); and letters describing
      the work of physicians in Albany, yellow fever in
      Philadelphia, local politics and the media. And one undated
      letter (ca. 1800) gives descriptions and opinions of
      alterations being made to a house. Other correspondents
      include Henricus Schoonmaker, Cornelius Elting, Elting
      Varick, Johannes Jansen, Elizabeth DeWitt and David
      Graham.</p>
      <p>Another batch of letters written to Jacob Elting, while he
      served as Elder of Reformed Dutch Church of New Paltz. These
      letters document the consistory’s efforts to acquire a new
      pastor in 1844. These include a letter of recommendation of
      Rev. Ransford Wells of Troy, New York, and letters from Jacob
      A. Lansing; Ch. Whitehead, pastor of the Ref. Dutch Church of
      Walden; Henry Ostrander, Catherine Jansen, and William A.
      Cornell. One letter concerns the plans of the Executive
      Committee of the Ulster County Agricultural Society to
      inspect local farms (1844), and another letter from 1864
      describes local efforts to send gift boxes to the 156th
      Regiment during the Civil War.</p>
      <p>Also of interest in this collection are the several
      account books kept by Roelof and Ezekiel Elting. The accounts
      books of Roelof Elting date from 1768 to 1791 and primarily
      relate to the family store located in the Bevier-Elting House
      on Huguenot Street in New Paltz. These books document
      transactions involving the purchase and sale of domestic
      goods, foodstuffs, kitchen supplies, textiles and clothing,
      hardware, and specialty items such as tobacco, snuff, writing
      supplies, and other items. The accounts in these books are
      fairly scattered with no apparent organizational scheme.
      Among these five account books are two books containing
      entries deserving specific mention. One appears to be a store
      inventory from 1768 listing all the items in the store,
      although the prices are not listed. Another book contains
      journal-style entries from 1776 and 1777 written by Roelof
      Elting concerning his imprisonment as a suspected British
      sympathizer during the Revolutionary War.</p>
      <p>Four account books kept by Ezekiel Elting span the years
      from 1821 to 1845 and mainly relate to mill and farm
      expenses. The majority of the entries concern the purchase
      and sale of grains such as rye, corn, buckwheat, and wheat.
      Also present, however, are numerous entries documenting
      payments to laborers for sawing and chopping wood, carding
      wool, harvesting crops, and various other tasks. A name index
      at the beginning of each book serves as the main point of
      access to individual accounts. Another account book kept by
      Ezekiel Elting and his brother can be found in a collection
      of papers located at the Haviland-Heidgerd Historical
      Collection at the Elting Memorial Library in New Paltz. A
      brief description of this collection is provided below.</p>
      <p>The estate papers mainly consist of bonds, deeds,
      mortgages, property descriptions, probate records, court
      papers, and agreements concerning properties in Ulster County
      (particularly New Paltz and Lloyd) owned by the Elting family
      in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Of interest are
      deeds of the Hasbrouck, Bevier, Deyo, LeFevre, Donaldson, and
      Roelof and Josiah and Noah Elting families (1703-1767);
      estate inventories of Roelof J. Elting (1773, 1795) , Edmond
      Turner (undated), Elizabeth Schutt (1790), Nathaniel Bevier
      (1796), Mary Elting (1801); Mariah(?) DuBois (1839) and wills
      and probate records of Josiah Elting (1784) and Ezekiel
      Elting (1843). Several of the legal papers from the later
      nineteenth century concern the New Paltz Turnpike.</p>
      <p>Also of note are undated field books to tracts and lots in
      the New Paltz Patent; undated copybook of Simeon DeWitt,
      Surveyor General of New York State; a receipt and agreement
      concerning the Reformed Church of New Paltz (1774-1790);
      register of poor persons applying for relief (1790); and
      account books, one of which contains entries written by
      Roelof Josiah Elting describing his imprisonment and
      probation during the Revolutionary War. There is also a
      document dating from 1810 drawn up by “The Society of Negroes
      Unsettled” of which Ezekiel Elting was elected foreman,
      provides evidence of attempts by the slave owners in New
      Paltz to solve the problem of runaway slaves. This document
      also lists several slaves who ran away from their owners. An
      attached document contains a list of persons and their
      supposed whereabouts. It is uncertain if these persons are
      runaway slaves or free blacks who may provide refuge to the
      runaways. Also contained in the collection are albumen print
      photographs from the mid-late 19th century of Clarence
      Elting, Maggie Peters, Myron and Gertrude Wurtz, and one
      tintype of Esther Elting. Two other photographs show the
      Mohonk Mountain House across Lake Mohonk and an unidentified
      Federal-style brick house with 1st and 2nd story porches that
      was presumably the residence of Clarence Elting.</p>
      <p>The overall condition of the papers is good and the
      handwriting legible. Some documents show signs of damage from
      tearing or fading. Signatures from several of the legal
      papers dating from the 18th century have at some time been
      removed.</p>

          <p>Contains nine account books kept by Roelof Josiah
          Elting and his son Ezekiel Elting. The five small account
          books of Roelof Elting pertain to items bought and sold
          at the family store, church expenses and other accounts
          owed to him by those with whom he did business. One
          account book describes his imprisonment and probation
          during the Revolutionary War. Accounts in these books are
          generally sporadic and may have supplemented more
          complete daybooks or yearly ledgers. The four account
          books of Ezekiel Elting are legal size, bound ledgers,
          which contain personal name indexes; one account book,
          (1827-1833) contains no index, despite following the same
          system as the others. The transactions generally pertain
          to the purchases and sales of domestic goods such as
          wheat, corn, liquor, leather, etc.; and also payments for
          labor. This series also includes one folder of loose
          papers that may have come from another account book, and
          one name index to several unidentified account books.</p>
